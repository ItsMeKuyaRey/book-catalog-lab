# Book Catalog Lab

This is a basic HTML table project I built as a part of FreeCodeCamp's beginner labs.

It helps me understand:
- Semantic HTML elements like `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`
- Table structures
- HTML layout best practices

This marks my starting point as a noob programmer learning web development ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
